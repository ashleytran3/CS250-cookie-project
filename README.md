# CS250-cookie-project

This repository contains code that was developed for a project submitted for C++ Programming 2 (CS250) at Orange Coast College. It was a collaborative effort with Omar Abou-Harb, and Professor Hatice Aydin provided starter code. This project creates an interface that allows users to select different options that return different information about a predetermined list of 12 cookies.

### My Contributions:
- Developed and optimized key functions.
- Fixed syntax and formatting issues.

### Collaborator's Contributions:
- Assisted with optimization and function development.
- Conducted testing and debugging.

### Professor's Contributions:
- Provided starter code for key files and structures, including `Cookie.h`, `CookieDB.h`, and testing components.

This code was downloaded from the original submitted project and restructured for clarification and demonstration purposes.
